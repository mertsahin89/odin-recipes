    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <p><strong>To Prepare and Cook the Pizza</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>How to cook neopolitan style pizza at home? Start with pre-heating the oven to its maximum temperature at least 40 minutes before you cook the pizza (static mode – both bottom and top need to be heating up).</li>
        <li>Place the pizza stone at the bottom of the oven when you pre-heat it so it becomes extremely hot in temperature.</li>
        <li>When the oven has reached its maximum temp (you can normally check this by the light on the oven), open and shut it a few times. This will make it work a little harder to get hotter!</li>
        <li>Once you are happy with the temperature of the oven, 5 minutes before you’re ready to cook the pizza, switch the oven to grill/broiler mode.</li>
        <li>When it is time to cook the pizza, move the stone from the bottom of the oven to the top grill.</li>
        <li>Stretch out the pizza dough and assemble the pizza with tomato sauce, mozarella and toppings of your liking.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour on the pizza peel before transferring the pizza from it to the stone and then close the oven door and leave to cook.</li>
        <li>Once the pizza starts to colour, lift and rotate the pizza around slightly so it cooks evenly all over. You will need to do this every minute or so and turn the pizza approx. 45°.</li>
        <li>Once the pizza is cooked well at the bottom and the crust begins to golden, it is ready.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>To Serve the Pizza</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Simple – remove the pizza from the oven, slice and enjoy!</li>
        
    </ol>
