    <h2>Delicious Pesto Sauce With Fresh Basil</h2>
    <p><em>Fresh basil pesto is so easy to make and one of the most versatile condiments in Italian cooking. It originated in the region of Liguria and when made fresh the salty flavour just dances on your tastebuds.</em></p>
    <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chopping-board</li>
        <li>Knife</li>
        <li>Blender </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Large bunch fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>10 grams Pine nuts 0.4oz</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Fine salt</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Parmigiano reggiano </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <p><strong>To Prepare the Sauce</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fresh basil pesto is all about the aroma, so if you have a basil plant at home, cut a bunch including the stalk as this will help the plant to grow back – fresh is always best!</li>
        <li>Rinse the basil leaves in a bowl of water and make sure you get rid of any insects, then lay each individual leaf on a paper towel to dry.</li>
        <li>To help dry the basil leaves for the fresh pesto place a paper towel on top of all them and press down very gently. This will help dry the leaves and absorb all the excess water.</li>
        <li>Blend olive oil & garlic first until you get a smooth, creamy consistency before adding the pine nuts and blending again.</li>
        <li>Next add basil leaves, pinch sea salt, 2 more tblsp oil and blend for 30 sec. If you find after this time there is still cheese all around the edges, scrape it off and into the fresh basil pesto and mix through using a tablespoon.</li>
        <li>Using a small spoon, taste the fresh basil pesto for salt and flavour – if it is too salty, add a touch extra basil and oil and pulse blend until you’re happy with the taste.</li>
        <li>Scoop it in a jar sealed tight and keep in the fridge, pairing it with delicious meals as often as you like!</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>To Serve the Sauce</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fresh basil pesto can be used with so many dishes, lathered over your pasta as a main or used as a dressing with lamb or even chicken. My favourite way is with ricotta gnocchi – just heat up a portion in a pan and once your gnocchi have finished cooking, strain them and put them straight into the pan so that they absorb all the fresh pesto, mix through and the taste will be just divine.</li>
    </ol>
